# brain_weights
measure the association of the other variables after taking into account the body size  

We would like to see if gestation length and litter size are associated with brain weight after controlling for different body sizes.  That is, we already know that brain size is related to body weight; therefore, we donâ€™t want body size to be a confounding variable.  We would like to measure the association of the other variables after taking into account the body size.
